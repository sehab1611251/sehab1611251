# Hi there! 👋 I'm [Pranta]

**Master's Student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering**

🔭 I’m currently working on my Master's thesis: "Human Pose Estimation and Group Detection Using Computer Vision."

🌱 I’m currently learning and exploring:
- Advanced Computer Vision Techniques
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Large-scale Data Processing

👨‍💻 Some of my key projects:
- [NLP-Project: Spam Detection in Emails Using RNN with Attention](https://github.com/sehab1611251/NLP-Project)
- [Clustering: Unsupervised Machine Learning project](https://github.com/sehab1611251/Clustering-Unsupervised-ML-Project)
- [Computer Vision Project: Road Defect Detection](https://github.com/sehab1611251/Road-Defect-Detection-Using-Image-Annotation)

⚡ Fun fact: I'm passionate about making AI systems solve real-world problems.
